                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! Here is our Education section, which records our various educational activities! We have designed a wide range of activities to increase public understanding of our projects and of synthetic biology. We hope to make more meaningful attempts in the future. Take a look at our activity log!
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h1>Questionnaire</h1>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to find out how much the public knows about keywords such as diabetic foot, synthetic biology and iGEM, we designed a questionnaire. We tried to make our questionnaire gentle, valid and not offensive to anyone, taking into account the protection of personal privacy and respect for patients. We posted it on a public platform and called for people to fill it in. We were very grateful and surprised to receive 178 responses. The data from the questionnaire was tallied and we drew conclusions. These findings have helped us to design targeted Education content.
                    </p>
                    <div class="btn">
                        问卷题目
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to better understand the information contained in the questionnaire responses, a summary of the data analysis and visualisation of the questionnaire was done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to understand people's understanding of chronic wounds of diabetes ulcer and synthetic biology, we used the form of issuing questionnaires to obtain relevant data information through the publicity of some social forums such as circles of friends, so that we can create educational materials suitable for filling the knowledge gap, and educate and influence people in the best way possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We choose the form of questionnaire because it is an effective tool to cover people of different ages. In addition, people are more likely to be completely honest when the survey is anonymous and provides results close to reality. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make the survey anonymous and ethical, we do not need to fill in some questions related to personal privacy, but only collect age information to ensure the wide coverage of the audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cover a wider audience, we not only carried out publicity in our social circle, but also published the questionnaire in the alumni circle, a common forum in the university, so as to collect more information for analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey was carried out successfully with 178 participants. It is distributed at all age levels. Most participants are between 18 and 30 years old (87.64%). Because of the wide range of surveys we distributed, we basically received questionnaires from all provinces in the country, most of which were from Zhejiang Province.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img">
                        两张图？
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first asked the people surveyed whether they had heard of chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers and how they learned about them. However, as shown in the figure, about three quarters of people have never heard of chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers, and the ways to understand them are relatively scattered, among which more are learned through popular science articles and short videos.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img">
                        一张图？
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to understand people's understanding of the basic situation of chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers, we asked for information about the three statements (Q1: Do you know that chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers may lead to amputation? Q2: Do you know that the prevalence of chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers is higher in men than in women? Q3: Do you know that the prevalence of chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers is higher in the elderly than in the young?) The results are shown in the figure, More than half of the people do not know this information. These information shows that people have very little knowledge about chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers and lack of relevant knowledge storage.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img">
                        三张图？
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also asked about the treatment of chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers (Q1: Do you think the causes of chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers include? Q2: Do you think chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers are easy to cure? Q3: Do you know that biological dressings can treat chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers? Q4: Do you think there are effective ways to treat chronic wounds caused by diabetes ulcers?) The results are also not optimistic, In addition to the fact that people know a lot about the causes of chronic wounds of diabetes ulcers and whether they are easy to treat (but both are less than 50%), they do not know much about other effective treatments.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img">
                        四张图？
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, we can find that people know little about chronic wounds of diabetes ulcers from the survey of chronic wounds of diabetes ulcers, so it is extremely necessary to carry out relevant science education and product publicity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also investigated some questions about synthetic biology, including whether we are interested in synthetic biology, think that synthetic biology can be applied to chronic wounds of diabetes ulcers, and open questions: do you have any questions or areas of concern about synthetic biology /diabetes ulcers that you want to know?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results show that there is not much understanding of synthetic biology, and there are many problems in the field of synthetic biology /diabetes ulcer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is also necessary for us to carry out popular science publicity on the relevant content in the field of synthetic biology, so that more people can have a certain understanding of this field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the questionnaire, we designed targeted WeChat scientific tweets, including an introduction to diabetic foot and preventive measures, an introduction to synthetic biology and iGEM, and an introduction to GluLeaves. Until Feb 8th , we have received 335+ views. We plan to upload our project introduction video to the video platform. We look forward to making more interesting Educational attempts in the future, such as going to school to introduce synthetic biology to students and producing more meaningful content.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wrote and produced Pamphlets about our project and disease prevention-related publicity pages. To enhance the dissemination of the texts, we tried to use easy-to-understand language so that they could be read and accepted by as many people as possible. In order to have a worldwide impact, we produced a total of eight language versions, including English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, French and Russian. We have attached our flyer here so that you can download it.
