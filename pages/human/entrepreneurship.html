                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diabetes is a common chronic metabolic disorder and diabetic wound healing is an extremely complex physiological process for which there is still no ideal treatment option. The number of people with diabetes in China has reached 
                        <b>over 100 million</b>,
                        and around <b>25%</b> of all diabetics are affected by the diabetic foot.
                        Studies have shown that in over two-thirds (<b>84%</b>) of non-traumatic lower limb amputations due to diabetic foot, the patient will have developed an ulcer in the early stages.
                        This suggests that the diabetic foot is a condition that <b>needs to be addressed urgently</b>.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Our vision</b> is to establish ourselves as <b>a promising and profitable business</b> by offering synthetic biology solutions in the treatment of the diabetic foot. Helping people with early diabetic foot ulcers is a goal we adhere to and we want to provide them with <b>safe, effective and affordable</b> treatments.

                    <h1>Market Analysis</h1>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a common complication of poorly controlled diabetes, the diabetic foot ulcer forms when the skin tissue breaks down and exposes the underlying layer. It is usually located on the bottom of the foot. The main causes of diabetic ulcers include hyperglycaemia, nerve damage and irritation or injury to the foot. An analysis of global data on diabetes and the diabetic foot can be found in <a a href="./integrated.html#understanding" target="_top">the Understanding section</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) treatment market is estimated at $4,786.5 million in 2021 and is projected to be <b>$7,376.5 million</b> adjusted by 2028, growing at <b>a CAGR of 6.4%</b> during the review period 2022-2028.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing population affected by diabetes and subsequent increase in the number of people suffering from diabetic foot ulcers is likely to have a positive impact on the global diabetic foot ulcer treatment market during the forecast period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing prevalence of diabetes and subsequent rise in the incidence of diabetic foot ulcers is expected to drive the growth of the global diabetic foot ulcer treatment market over the forecast period. The high cost of diabetic foot ulcer drugs and care is a major market restraint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North America is the largest consumer, with a consumption market share of nearly 39.34% in 2021. Europe is the second largest consumer after North America with a consumption market share of 32.5%.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DFU treatment market is highly competitive. The main products currently available in the market are wound care dressings, biologics, therapeutic devices, antibiotic drugs, etc. 3M, Smith & Nephew, Molnlycke Health Care, ConvaTec, Organogenesis, etc. are industry leaders <b>with high-end customers</b>. In terms of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) treatment revenue in 2021, the top five manufacturers account for <b>53.9%</b> of the market share.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic medical-grade hydrogel market currently has broad prospects and is shining in the pharmaceutical field. However, the combination of hydrogel and synthetic biology is rare till now. On one hand, due to the integration of synthetic biology into hydrogel dressings, its safety and effectiveness need to be verified, on the other hand, patent issues in the combination of technologies need to be considered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we hope to do our best to promote and contribute to the field of the combination of hydrogel and synthetic biology. And at the same time <b>clarifying the scope of intellectual property rights, establishing an effective intellectual property operation environment and institutional settings</b> so that we will avoid difficulties causing by intellectual property problems in the future.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this, we will <b>consult relevant professionals</b> to apply for a concept patent as soon as possible. If it is possible, we plan to apply for an invention patent and a utility patent for our engineered C. reinhardti and the whole product respectively. In the longer term, as the promotion of product development and approaching time to the market, the number of patent layouts around product-related components, devices, materials and other fields will increase, and eventually we will achieve the protection of product innovation and competitive advantage through <b>patent portfolios</b>.

                        <h2>Preliminary Financial Model</h2>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to our cost estimates, the cost of a foot ulcer treatment product is 76¥.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes 30¥ for the guard + 16¥ for the sensor + 5¥ for the LED device + 20¥ for the hydrogel (including the base substances haemoglobin, filipin, polyvinyl alcohol, etc.) + 3¥ for the added substances (antibacterial peptides, fluorescein, iron ions) + 2¥ for the packaging costs.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of replacing the treatment gel is 23¥
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a 30% commercial profit, the minimum selling price for the merchandise set is: 98.8¥ and the minimum selling price for the replacement gel is: 29.9¥.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wholesaler prices are 99¥ and 30¥ respectively<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmacies recommend selling at 129¥ and 32¥ respectively.                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, at this pricing, we will make a minimum profit of 22.8¥ per serving and 6.9¥ per replacement gel sold.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will invest these profits in product upgrades, company operations, marketing and many other areas to expand our reach. We will be reaching out to more stakeholders in the future to help us build our financial model.

                        <p>
                            (1) <b>In the early stage</b>, market-skimming pricing is used to capture a large amount of profit in a relatively short period of time by virtue of the product's unique technological advantage and novelty, so as to provide sufficient capital for the development in the middle and later stages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (2) <b>In the formative stage</b>, satisfactory pricing is used to capture as much market share as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (3) <b>In the mature stage</b>, the company has already achieved a certain market position and has certain bargaining power, and follows the profit maximisation principle in pricing.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Future Plan</h2>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to our estimates, if we can add sensors and a line of hydrogels at a later stage, our costs can be <b>less than $56</b>. In addition, the foot hardware meets the criteria for sustainable use by simply replacing the gel dressing. We will try to reduce the cost of the gel dressing and introduce a combination of sets suitable for the treatment steps to be sold to ensure the affordability of this treatment option.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2022, researchers from the European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO) published a review article in Nature Communications, Bottlenecks and opportunities for synthetic biology biosafety standards biosafety standards), suggesting that biosafety standardisation needs to be supported in order to facilitate the flourishing of synthetic biology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of innovative biosafety standards for synthetic biology is not only an unresolved policy gap, but also limits many potential applications of synthetic biology.
                        </p>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as we expand the influence of synthetic biology, we will actively <b>seek dialogue opportunities with governments</b> to seek to accelerate the process of <b>developing biosafety standards</b> for synthetic biology and contribute to the upstream and downstream of the synthetic biology industry.
