                    <p>
                        Chronic diabetic wounds are one of several common complications of diabetes, manifested by extensive wound ulceration, persistent infection, and nerve damage, especially in the feet, and in severe cases, amputation. People with diabetes have a 15-20 times higher risk of amputation than normal people. Fortunately, 85% of amputations are accessible due to the early onset of symptoms. It is important to promote early healing of diabetic wounds. That's why we designed a new portable wound protector that combines our engineered algae to protect diabetic wounds and promote healing. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on the sterile environment of the wound, we designed the dressing to ensure the sterile environment, and added a protective gear to detect the wound in real time. Since it is mainly aimed at the elderly group, the feedback mechanism uses intuitive protective gear light changes and alarm sounds to keep patients informed of the wound situation.

                            <p>
                                Material: anti-fouling and sterilization bifunctional polypropylene non-woven fabric (P non-woven fabric).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PP non-woven fabric has the advantages of good air permeability, excellent stability and low price, and is a kind of medical dressing with more applications. However, in a physiological environment, hydrophobic PP surfaces readily trigger bacterial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation. To solve this problem, we co-deposit dopamine/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PDA/PVP) on the surface of the nonwoven. Because PDA has excellent bio-adhesion and can form a strong hydrogen bond with PVP, the resulting coating is firm. Subsequently, the terminal aminopolyethylene glycol (PEG-NH2) was used to react with the PDA Schiff base or Michael addition to introduce the antifouling PEG group to the surface of the coating, which gave the coating excellent anti-bacterial adhesion properties. In order to obtain better antibacterial performance, PVP and iodine (I2) in the coating were complexed to form a PVP-I complex, and the I2 bactericidal group was introduced to construct a PP non-woven surface with anti-fouling and bactericidal synergy.

Then, dialysis with boric acid buffer was added to further reduce the β-folding of silk fibroin solution, avoid gelation of silk fibroin solution, and increase the stability of silk fibroin solution, so as to obtain stable target concentration of silk fibroin aqueous solution at low temperature concentration, so as to improve the degree of crosslinking and significantly improve the mechanical strength of the gel.

                                The object that needs to detect color should be placed in front of the circuit/sensor. The light reflected from the object falls on the three convex lenses mounted in front of the three LDRs. Convex lenses are used to concentrate light. This helps to improve the sensitivity of the LDR, and the blue-green-red glass plates (filters) are fixed in front of LDR1, LDR2, and LDR3, respectively. When the reflected light from the object falls on the device, the colored filter glass plate decides which LDR will be triggered. The circuit uses only AND and NOT gates.

                                When primary color light falls on the system, a glass plate corresponding to that primary color will allow specific light to pass through. However, the other two glass plates do not allow any light to pass through. Therefore, only one specific LDR will be triggered, and the gate output corresponding to that LDR will change to a logic 1 to indicate which color it can be.

                                Similarly, when a second color light falls on the system, two primary color glass plates corresponding to the mixed color will allow that light to pass through, while the remaining glass plate will not allow any light to pass through it. As a result, two LDRs are triggered, and the gate outputs corresponding to these become logic 1s and indicate which color it really is.

                        The dressing is applied to the wound first, and then the ankle or other areas are wrapped with a protective gear. The feedback site flashes green at the initial state, white if no infection occurs at the end of treatment, and yellow light if infection occurs. If infection occurs, the buzzer operates at the same time to sound an alarm. The patient can change the dressing by removing the brace.
